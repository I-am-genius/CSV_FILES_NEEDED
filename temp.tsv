Given our limited consumption of these vegetables, a&nbsp;supplement is the only other means of enjoying their remarkable benefits. Unfortunately, making an ethical supplement was not possible until recently, because doing so requires more than putting dried veggies in a pill. In fact, the only way for a vitamin to provide the benefits of these vegetables is via extracts verified to deliver specific beneficial compounds from each vegetable.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Andrew's Cruciferous Extracts formula has been in&nbsp;development for more than a decade, and now we can finally deliver certified standardized extracts of key compounds from a wide variety of cruciferous vegetables. The most important of these cruciferous extracts are the glucosinolates, including sulforaphane. Glucosinolates are a very broad family of extremely beneficial compounds that give cruciferous vegetables their characteristic taste and are also responsible for their health benefits.<br /> <br /> The brussels sprouts, kale, wasabi and mustard seed extracts in this formula are standardized for high levels of glucosinolates, including the remarkable 20% level found in our mustard seed extract. Two of&nbsp;the extracts are standardized&nbsp;for sulforaphane, including broccoli extract, which is our most potent ever at an amazing 1.2% sulforaphane.

Unfortunately, making an ethical supplement was not possible until recently, because doing so requires more than putting dried veggies in a pill. In fact, the only way for a vitamin to provide the benefits of these vegetables is via extracts verified to deliver specific beneficial compounds from each vegetable.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Andrew's Cruciferous Extracts formula has been in&nbsp;development for more than a decade, and now we can finally deliver certified standardized extracts of key compounds from a wide variety of cruciferous vegetables. The most important of these cruciferous extracts are the glucosinolates, including sulforaphane. Glucosinolates are a very broad family of extremely beneficial compounds that give cruciferous vegetables their characteristic taste and are also responsible for their health benefits.<br /> <br /> The brussels sprouts, kale, wasabi and mustard seed extracts in this formula are standardized for high levels of glucosinolates, including the remarkable 20% level found in our mustard seed extract. Two of&nbsp;the extracts are standardized&nbsp;for sulforaphane, including broccoli extract, which is our most potent ever at an amazing 1.2% sulforaphane. Sulforaphane is the compound attributed with broccoli's long list of health benefits.<br /> <br /> Cruciferous Extracts is rounded out with extracts of red cabbage, standardized for high levels of polyphenols and anthocyanins. This formula&nbsp;is a unique blend of standardized extracts from a broad array of cruciferous vegetables to provide a convenient and&nbsp;economical tool to help overcome the absence of these remarkable foods and their health benefits from our diet.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>What You Get</strong> <br /> <br /> <table>     <tbody>         <tr>             <td>             <ul class=""ulolProdDesc"">                 <li>360 Cruciferous Extracts capsules</li>             </ul>             </td>         </tr>     </tbody> </table> <br /> Made in USA<br /> <br /> <strong>Good to Know</strong>"	Cruciferous Vegetable Extracts - 360 Capsules	Cruciferous Vegetable Extracts - 360 Capsules - Item: 389-337, Vitamins & Supplements, home shopping network, shop at home, hsn.com	https://www.hsn.com/products/seo/4735050?sz=3&sf=HF0086&ac=	https://i01.hsncdn.com/is/image/HomeShoppingNetwork/389337?$icn125$	Andrew Lessman	108090		SN	848970022277			Y	NEW	.00	Free Shipping|Customer Pick|Flex Pay Option|Financing Options		129.90			786	786	;Financing Options;;;;;;		FALSE	https://i01.hsncdn.com/is/image/HomeShoppingNetwork/389337?$pd500$	https://i01.hsncdn.com/is/image/HomeShoppingNetwork/389337_alt99?$pd500$									FALSE			Adult	Female	https://i01.hsncdn.com/is/image/HomeShoppingNetwork/389337?$pd1001$	HEALTH & FITNESS	Health & Fitness	Vitamins & Supplements	Antioxidant Vitamins		Cruciferous Vegetable Extracts  360 Capsules	false	Find Top Physical & Personal	Healthcare Products!

Medical experts recognize that our Total Cholesterol and LDL (<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">L</span></strong>ow <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">D</span></strong>ensity <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">L</span></strong>ipoprotein) Cholesterol levels are important indicators of our cardiovascular health or risk. The Food and Drug Administration now recognizes that Phytosterols, like those contained in CholestaCare, provide a natural means of lowering Total and LDL Cholesterol, and thereby supporting heart health. <br /> <br /> Although naturally present in fruits, vegetables and grains, most Americans do not consume adequate amounts of these foods to achieve the recommended levels of the plant sterols necessary to positively affect their Cholesterol levels. Moreover, the foods that most Americans consume tend to deliver high levels of saturated fats and cholesterol, which can increase Total Cholesterol and other cardiovascular risk factors. Scientific evidence establishes that including adequate amounts of plant sterols in the diet helps to lower Total Cholesterol and LDL Cholesterol levels, which is important for heart health since high Total Cholesterol and high LDL Cholesterol levels are associated with an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. <br /> <br /> <strong><em>According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, consuming at least 400 mg per serving of plant sterols twice daily with meals for a daily total intake of at least 800 mg, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. A capsule of CholestaCare supplies 400 milligrams of plant sterols. <br /> </em></strong><br /> Of course, an intelligent approach to heart health and cholesterol reduction involves more than simply consuming CholestaCare daily, and should also include a sensible dietary, exercise and weight control program under the guidance of a health care professional. <br /> <br /> <strong>What You Get</strong> <br /> <br /> <table>     <tbody>         <tr>             <td>             <ul class=""ulolProdDesc"">                 <li>720 CholestaCare capsules </li>             </ul>             </td>         </tr>     </tbody> </table> <br /> Made in USA<br /> <br /> <strong>Good to Know</strong>"	CholestaCare - 720 Capsules	CholestaCare - 720 Capsules - Item: 456-067, Vitamins & Supplements, home shopping network, shop at home, hsn.com	https://www.hsn.com/products/seo/5504700?sz=3&sf=HF0088&ac=	https://i01.hsncdn.com/is/image/HomeShoppingNetwork/456067?$icn125$	Andrew Lessman	108062		SN	848970015712			Y	NEW	.00	Free Shipping|Customer Pick|Flex Pay Option|Financing Options		179.90			1528	1528	;Financing Options;;;;;;		FALSE	https://i01.hsncdn.com/is/image/HomeShoppingNetwork/456067?$pd500$										FALSE			Adult	Female	https://i01.hsncdn.com/is/image/HomeShoppingNetwork/456067?$pd1001$	HEALTH & FITNESS	Health & Fitness	Vitamins & Supplements	Cholesterol Vitamins		CholestaCare  720 Capsules	false	Find Top Physical & Personal	Healthcare Products!

6150939		Jasmine Infused Organic Green Tea - 60 Sachets	32.90		21.10	Health & Fitness > Vitamins & Supplements > Antioxidant Vitamins	"<strong>Jasmine Infused Organic Green Tea</strong><br /> My Jasmine Infused Organic Green Tea is made in the traditional way of a bygone era. It is mild and delicious - without a hint of bitterness. Each cup reminds me of a simpler time when tea was brewed with great devotion and enjoyed in complete tranquility.<br /> <br /> Our Jasmine Green Tea is made the old fashioned way and contains no Jasmine blossoms. Instead, when our Green Tea is ready for drying, we introduce freshly-picked autumn Jasmine flowers to the drying room. As the Jasmine blossoms open, warm air is circulated throughout the room, causing the natural Jasmine fragrance to infuse our Green Tea. This process is repeated seven times over several days to achieve the perfect balance and flavor. This is the same centuries-old, traditional method by which the world's finest Jasmine Green Tea has been made.<br /> <br /> We use only Single Region Premium Organic Green Tea from Fujian, China. This tea is well known for its mildness, making it perfect for Americans. The capital of Fujian is Fuzhou - a city renowned for its Jasmine, making it the home of China's and our highest quality Jasmine Green Tea.<br /> <br /> There is no beverage with a longer history of traditional use than Green Tea. There is also no beverage with more science to support its healthy use. Special compounds in Green Tea called Polyphenols are responsible for its benefits with EGCG (Epigallocatechin Gallate) being the most important of these Polyphenols. My Jasmine Infused Green Tea delivers high levels of both Polyphenols (almost 20%) and EGCG (25% of Polyphenols) with less than 3% caffeine, making it far milder than a typical cup of coffee or tea.<br /> <br /> Originating almost 5,000 years ago in China, Green Tea is second only to water as the world's most popular beverage. Interest in Green Tea's health benefits continues to grow, but since most Americans don't enjoy Green Tea's flavor, we miss out on all its benefits. This is, until now,&nbsp;since I expect that my new Jasmine Infused Green Tea will satisfy even the most finicky American taste buds.<br /> <br /> <strong>What You Get <br /> </strong><br /> <table>     <tbody>         <tr>             <td>             <ul class=""ulolProdDesc"">                 <li>60 individually sealed sachets of&nbsp;Jasmine Infused Organic Green Tea </li>             </ul>             </td>         </tr>     </tbody> </table> <br /> Made in USA<br /> <br /> <p></p>"	Jasmine Infused Green Tea	Jasmine Infused Organic Green Tea - 60 Sachets - Item: 964-686, Vitamins & Supplements, home shopping network, shop at home, hsn.com	https://www.hsn.com/products/seo/6150939?sz=3&sf=HF0086&ac=	https://i01.hsncdn.com/is/image/HomeShoppingNetwork/964686?$icn125$	Andrew Lessman	102867		SN				Y	NEW	.00	Free Shipping|Customer Pick|Flex Pay Option|Financing Options		44.90			53	53	;Financing Options;;;;;;		FALSE	https://i01.hsncdn.com/is/image/HomeShoppingNetwork/964686?$pd500$	https://i01.hsncdn.com/is/image/HomeShoppingNetwork/964686_alt1?$pd500$									FALSE			Adult	Female	https://i01.hsncdn.com/is/image/HomeShoppingNetwork/964686?$pd1001$	HEALTH & FITNESS	Health & Fitness	Vitamins & Supplements	Antioxidant Vitamins		Jasmine Infused Organic Green Tea  60 Sachets	false	Find Top Physical & Personal	Healthcare Products!
